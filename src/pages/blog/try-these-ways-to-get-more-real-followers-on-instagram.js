                    If you want to get more real followers on Instagram, you
                    will need to think about your target audience. Once you are
                    clear about your audience, you will be able to focus more on
                    posting quality content that is appealing to them. If your
                    audience is not interested in the kind of content you are
                    posting, they will never share it even if you offer quality.
                    On the other hand, if you post what people want to see, they
                    may share your posts, which will help you gain more
                    followers.&nbsp;

                  <span className="s1">
                    When we talk about targeting an audience, you will need to
                    consider age, gender, location, and other similar factors.
                    If you keep these factors in mind while creating content,
                    things will be much easier for you.&nbsp;

                    If you want to grow on Instagram, you will need to keep
                    posting consistently. You should post at least two-three
                    times a day. Moreover, you should keep your audience engaged
                    by posting stories from time to time. If you post
                    consistently, you will keep getting impressions on your
                    posts, which will help you grow. However, you should not
                    overwhelm your audience by posting every five minutes. You
                    may lose some existing followers in such a case, which is
                    the last thing you would want.&nbsp;

                    If someone shares your post, it will definitely give you a
                    boost. More people will get to know about you, and if they
                    like your content, they may follow you as well. You will be
                    able to gain more followers this way. But if your posts
                    don&rsquo;t offer quality, people may not share them at all.
                    Also, if you aren&rsquo;t offering quality to your existing
                    followers, they may unfollow you. So make sure that you keep
                    working on the quality of your content. With time, things
                    will become easier for you as you will know what your
                    audience likes.&nbsp;

                    If you already have a follower base on some other social
                    media platform, you can make it easier for people to find
                    you by sharing your account details. You can share a link to
                    your Instagram account and ask your followers to check it
                    out. This way, you can gain a few followers without putting

                    Using hashtags is a great way of making your posts
                    discoverable. Whenever you post something, you can use a few
                    relevant hashtags. You should try using the hashtags that
                    people in your target audience are more likely to check, as
                    it will increase your chances of gaining more

                    You should not follow every second user that you find on

                    credibility. However, following a few relevant users may
                    prove beneficial for you. When you follow a person on
                    Instagram, he may check out your account as well. If you
                    have posted quality content, and he finds it appealing, he
                    may start following you.
