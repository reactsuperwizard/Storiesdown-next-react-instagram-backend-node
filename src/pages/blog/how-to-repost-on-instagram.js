                    If you find a post on Instagram that you want to share with
                    your followers, you may consider reposting it. When we talk
                    about other popular social media networks like Facebook and
                    Twitter, you can repost by sharing or retweeting. But there
                    are no such features on Instagram, and you can&rsquo;t
                    directly repost something on your feed. However, you can
                    send it as a message to someone, and if the account is
                    private, the person will be able to enjoy the post.&nbsp;

                <p className="p2">
                  <span className="s1">
                    But it isn&rsquo;t going to be fun as you won&rsquo;t be
                    able to share it with all your followers at once. In this
                    article, we will discuss two simple methods that you can use
                    to repost on Instagram. Let&rsquo;s have a look at them one
                    by one.&nbsp;
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p className="p3">
                  <span className="s1">
                    <h2>How to repost on Instagram?</h2>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <div className="my-4 text-center">
                  <img
                    className="w-100"
                    src="https://i.imgur.com/9nheoSx.jpg"
                  />
                </div>
                <p>
                  <span className="s1">
                    <h4>1. Post it as your story&nbsp;</h4>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p className="p1">
                  <span className="s1">
                    If there is a post on Instagram that you want to share with
                    all your followers, you can post it as your story. All your
                    followers will be able to see it for the next 24 hours. To
                    post it as your story, you will need to follow a few simple
                    steps. Firstly, you will need to find the post that you want
                    to repost as your story.&nbsp;
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p className="p1">
                  <span className="s1">
                    Once you find it, you will need to tap on share, next to the
                    comment button. You will get an option to send it directly
                    to people as well; however, you will need to tap on
                    &lsquo;Add Post To Your Story&rsquo;. Once you tap on it,
                    you will be able to repost it as your story, and your
                    followers will be able to enjoy the post.&nbsp;
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p className="p5">
                  <span className="s1">
                    But if the account is private, you may not be able to repost
                    it as your story directly. In such a case, you will need to
                    follow a different approach. Let&rsquo;s see how you can
                    repost as your story if the account is private.&nbsp;
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p className="p6">
                  <span className="s1">
                    <strong>What if the account is private?</strong>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p className="p1">
                  <span className="s1">
                    If the account is private, but you have followed it, you
                    will be able to see all the posts. You can take a screenshot
                    of the post and save it to the &lsquo;Gallery&rsquo; of your
                    device. Go to &lsquo;Gallery&rsquo; and find the screenshot
                    that you have just taken. You will need to crop the image,
                    which will take a few seconds.&nbsp;
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p className="p7">
                  <span className="s1">
                    After the image is cropped, you can post it as your story on
                    Instagram and share it with your followers. If you follow
                    this approach, make sure that you give credit to the source.
                    Now, let&rsquo;s see how to repost on your feed.&nbsp;
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span className="s1">
                    <h4>2. Repost it on your feed&nbsp;</h4>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p className="p1">
                  <span className="s1">
                    You won&rsquo;t be able to repost directly to your feed on
                    Instagram. However, you can follow the other approach that
                    we discussed above. To repost on Instagram, you will need to
                    find the post that you want your followers to enjoy. Once
                    you find the post, take a screenshot as we discussed in the
                    case of reposting as a story.&nbsp;
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p className="p1">
                  <span className="s1">
                    When you take the screenshot, the image will be saved to the
                    &lsquo;Gallery&rsquo; of your device. But you will need to
                    be more careful while editing as you will be posting it on
                    your feed and it isn&rsquo;t going to disappear after 24
                    hours. So make sure that the image is cropped properly
                    before posting it on Instagram. When you are done with
                    editing the image, open Instagram, and go to the upload
                    section.&nbsp;
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p className="p1">
                  <span className="s1">
                    Select the image that you just edited and post it. All your
                    followers will be able to enjoy the post and if they like
                    it, they may also repost it. As we discussed above, it would
                    be better to give credit to the source. The best thing about
                    reposting on Instagram by using this method is that you can
                    do it if the account is private as well. But you will need
                    to follow it first as you won&rsquo;t be able to see the
                    posts if you haven&rsquo;t followed it.&nbsp;
                  </span>
                </p>

                    Well, this is how easy it is to repost on Instagram. If you
                    like a post and want to share it with others, you can use
                    any of the above-mentioned methods. Both the methods that we
                    have mentioned are very simple to follow, and you will not
                    face any issues while reposting on Instagram if you follow
