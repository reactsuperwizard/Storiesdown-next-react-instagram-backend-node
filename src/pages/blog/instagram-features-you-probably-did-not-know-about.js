                    We all log in to our Instagram accounts every day and share
                    something new with our followers. The process is pretty
                    simple; click a picture, edit it, add a caption, and post
                    it. However, we often fail to notice the changes that are
                    made to the app every time an update rolls out. You can do a
                    lot more on Instagram, and in this article, we are going to
                    discuss some Instagram features that you probably

                    have a look at some amazing Instagram features.&nbsp;

                    If you don&rsquo;t want your followers to see a particular
                    post on your profile, you may consider deleting it. But it
                    will be gone forever this way and if you change your mind
                    after some time, you will not be able to bring it back. You
                    will need to post it again, which may not be the best
                    option. However, you can easily combat such a situation by
                    using this feature of Instagram.&nbsp;

                    You can archive a post on Instagram if you don&rsquo;t want
                    to hide it. It will take a few seconds to archive it, and
                    you will be able to get rid of the post. In the future, if
                    you want to recover that post, you can easily do it and
                    bring it back to your profile. This is how you can archive a

                    If someone keeps on posting stories, you may get frustrated

                    When you are new to the Instagram world, you may not get a
                    lot of comments on your posts. But as you grow, you will
                    gain followers, and people may start leaving comments on
                    your posts. Getting comments on your posts is a good thing;
                    however, getting offensive comments can be frustrating. You

                    can block comments from specific users. If someone is
                    leaving offensive comments on your posts, you can stop him
                    from doing that. You can also use filters like &lsquo;Hide
