                    The blue verification tick you see on Instagram accounts
                    signifies their authenticity. You will see verification
                    ticks on other social media platforms as well, and you
                    should know that they aren&rsquo;t designed to represent
                    status. But getting your account verified feels cool,

                    This is the first thing that will come into play when we
                    talk about getting verified on Instagram. Your account must
                    be authentic, and it must represent a real person, entity,
                    or registered business.&nbsp;

                  <span className="s1">
                    The uniqueness of your account is another important

                    get verified.&nbsp;

                    In order to get your Instagram account verified, you will
                    need to keep it public. If your account is private, you may
                    not be able to get the blue verification tick. So, if your
                    Instagram account is private, you will need to make it

                    Another important thing that you will need to take care of

                    If you want to become an authentic influencer, having a
                    follower base is very important. If you have over one
                    million followers on Instagram, it may be easier for you to
                    get a verification badge. On the other hand, if you have
                    only 100 followers, things are going to be difficult for
                    you. But there is no point in having a follower base if you
                    aren&rsquo;t getting engagement on your posts.&nbsp;

                    You should focus on getting quality followers who will
                    engage with your posts and interact with you. To achieve
                    this goal, you will need to be consistent with your posts,
                    and you will need to work on the quality of your posts as

                    Being clear about your niche may also increase your chances
