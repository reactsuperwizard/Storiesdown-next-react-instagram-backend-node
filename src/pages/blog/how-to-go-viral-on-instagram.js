                    Understanding your audience is going to be very important if
                    you want to go viral on Instagram. Firstly, you will need to
                    know what kind of content your audience is interested in,
                    and what are the things that they don&rsquo;t like at all.
                    Posting content that looks unappealing to your audience will
                    not be beneficial for you. To understand your audience, you
                    should consider factors like age, location, gender, and
                    annual income.&nbsp;

                    If you target your audience on Instagram, it will be easier
                    for you to go viral as you will be focusing on people who
                    are interested in your content. So, it will be better to
                    consider the above-mentioned factors before posting on
                    Instagram.&nbsp;

                    If you want to go viral on a social media platform, it is

                    same things that others are posting, it may be hard for you
                    to stand out in the crowd. But if you are creating unique
                    content, people may like and share it, which will help you
                    grow. Moreover, people will appreciate your efforts if you
                    provide them with new content.&nbsp;
