                    The number of likes you get on your Instagram posts says a
                    lot about them. If you are getting a good number of likes on
                    your posts, it will look more appealing to your followers.

                  <span className="s1">
                    Whenever we talk about increasing engagement on Instagram,
                    posting consistently becomes very important. You should keep
                    your feed fresh and try to keep your followers engaged with
                    your content. Posting once or twice a day can do the job for
                    you, and you can consider posting three to four times on
                    weekends.&nbsp;
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p className="p5">
                  <span className="s1">
                    If you keep posting consistently, you will be able to get
                    more impressions on your posts, which will prove beneficial
                    for you. However, you shouldn&rsquo;t post ten times in an
                    hour as it may be frustrating for your followers. You should
                    avoid doing this as you may lose some followers, which is
                    something that nobody would want.&nbsp;

                  <span className="s1">
                    Partnering with micro-influencers can do wonders for your
                    brand, as it can help you increase engagement on Instagram.
                    Micro-influencers are more affordable and you can easily
                    reach out to them as well. If an influencer shares your
                    post, you will get more engagement on your posts. At the
                    same time, it will send a message to people that your posts
                    are worth sharing.&nbsp;

                    Another way to increase engagement on Instagram is to post
                    visually appealing content. This tip is going to help you in
                    the long run as quality is a factor that you will always
                    need to keep in mind. Whenever you post something, it should
                    offer quality to the people who see it. If you post visually
                    appealing content, you are more likely to gain likes and
                    comments. Getting people to comment on your posts
                    isn&rsquo;t easy.&nbsp;

                  <span className="s1">
                    You should try to post what your followers want to see.
                    Keeping your audience&rsquo;s interests in mind is very
                    important if you want to be successful on Instagram. You
                    will need to consider a few factors like age, gender, and
                    locality of your followers while posting. Moreover, you
                    should avoid posting content that can offend someone, as it
                    may affect your reputation. People may also leave negative
                    comments on your posts, which is the last thing you would
                    want.&nbsp;

                <p className="p1">
                  <span className="s1">
                    Hosting contests is a great way of increasing engagement as
                    such posts may attract people. You will need to offer an
                    appealing prize to your followers if you want them to
                    participate in the contest. Since you will get to decide the
                    rules of the contest, you can ask people to like your posts
                    and leave a comment on them. You can also ask them to tag
                    their friends on your posts, which will also increase
                    engagement. Moreover, you can ask them to share your posts,
                    which will help you get more impressions as well.&nbsp;

                    well. But make sure that the winner gets the prize you
                    promised. You can run such contests every once in a while to
                    keep people engaged.&nbsp;
